# Marlin
All files needed for SKR E3 DIP v1.0 and TMC2130 with latest Marlin-bugfix-2.0.x
Configuration is for STM32F103RC and works on STM32F103RE as well but it's not enough room for full options like mesh bedleveling. I'll try to change to RE version.
Important notice.
use platformino core 4.0.3 ( board doesn't boot after compilation on 4.1.0).
trash your 128MB sdcard, it is garbage. Many people report problem with it.
